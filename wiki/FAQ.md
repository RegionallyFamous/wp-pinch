# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do I need Action Scheduler?

WP Pinch uses Action Scheduler for **scheduled governance tasks** (content freshness, SEO health, comment sweep, broken links, Draft Necromancer, Spaced Resurfacing) and **webhook retry queues**. Without it, governance features won't run — everything else works (abilities, Chat block, webhooks, MCP). If you have WooCommerce, Action Scheduler is already installed. Otherwise, install the [standalone package](https://github.com/woocommerce/action-scheduler/releases). A dismissible admin notice appears when it's missing.

---

## Does this require OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is recommended for the full experience (webhooks, chat, governance delivery), but the Abilities API and MCP server work with any MCP-compatible client. WP Pinch is the lobster; OpenClaw is the ocean. You can technically have a lobster without an ocean, but it's way less impressive.

---

## Where can I find step-by-step workflows?

See [Recipes](Recipes) for outcome-first flows (publish from chat, turn a post into social, capture ideas, etc.).

---

## What WordPress version is required?

6.9 or later. That's when WordPress grew its Abilities API claws.

---

## Does this work with WooCommerce?

Yes! WooCommerce order status changes trigger webhooks, and WP Pinch adds 30 WooCommerce abilities covering products, orders, inventory, fulfillment, refunds, coupons, customers, and analytics — when WooCommerce is active. See [Abilities Reference](Abilities-Reference#core-abilities) for the full list. Your AI agent can check inventory faster than a lobster can snap a rubber band.

---

## Can I add custom abilities?

Absolutely. Hook into `wp_pinch_register_abilities` and call `wp_register_ability()`:

```php
add_action( 'wp_pinch_register_abilities', function (): void {
    wp_register_ability(
        'myplugin/my-ability',
        array(
            'label'       => 'My Custom Ability',
            'description' => 'Does something custom.',
            'callback'    => 'my_custom_ability_callback',
            'category'    => 'wp-pinch',
            'meta'        => array( 'mcp' => array( 'public' => true ) ),
        )
    );
} );
```

If you can dream it, you can register it.

---

## Is it production-ready?

WP Pinch passes PHPCS (WordPress-Extra + Security), PHPStan Level 6, and 327 PHPUnit tests. Every ability has security guards, every input is sanitized, every output is escaped. It's as battle-tested as a lobster that survived the tank at Red Lobster.

---

## Is the API token stored securely?

It's stored in the WordPress options table with `show_in_rest => false`. For production hardening, we recommend using environment variables or a secrets manager. The token never appears in REST API responses and is never exposed to non-admin users. It's masked on the settings page.

---

## Can visitors chat without being logged in?

Yes, via Public Chat Mode. Enable the `public_chat` feature flag in **WP Pinch > Features**, then toggle the **Public Mode** setting on individual Pinch Chat blocks. Public chat uses a separate endpoint with its own rate limiting and session isolation. Each anonymous visitor gets a unique session key.

---

## What is Molt and how do I enable it?

Molt repackages a single post into multiple formats: social (Twitter, LinkedIn), email snippet, FAQ block, thread, summary, meta description, pull quote, key takeaways, and CTA variants. Use `/molt 123` in chat or the `wp-pinch/molt` ability. Molt is behind the `molt` feature flag — enable it in **WP Pinch > Features** to unlock.

---

## Can different pages have different AI agents?

Yes. Each Pinch Chat block has an **Agent ID** setting in the editor sidebar. Set it to override the global default agent for that specific block. You can have a sales assistant on your pricing page and a support agent on your docs page.

---

## I get 404 errors for admin.js and admin.css

You're running from source without built assets. Run `npm install && npm run build` in the plugin directory. The `build/` folder is generated by the build step and is not committed to the repo. If you installed via a release zip, the build is pre-included -- report it as a bug.

---

## Connection test fails — what do I check?

- **Gateway URL** must be a valid public HTTPS URL (no localhost). OpenClaw must be reachable from your WordPress server.
- **API Token** must match the token configured in OpenClaw. Copy it from the OpenClaw admin.
- **Firewall / security plugins** — Some hosts or plugins block outbound HTTP requests. Whitelist your Gateway URL or temporarily disable the plugin to test.
- **SSL certificate** — If the gateway uses a self-signed cert, WordPress may reject it. Use a proper cert for production.

---

## Chat block shows no response

- **Is streaming enabled?** Check **WP Pinch → Features** → enable **Streaming** if you expect real-time output.
- **Gateway URL and API Token** — Connection must be configured. Test in **WP Pinch → Connection**.
- **Public mode** — If the visitor isn't logged in, enable **Public Chat** in Features and **Public Mode** on the block.
- **Rate limit** — You may be hitting the chat rate limit. Check **WP Pinch → Connection** for limits.

---

## Governance tasks aren't running

- **Action Scheduler** is required. Install it (WooCommerce includes it) or the standalone package.
- **Tasks enabled?** Check **WP Pinch → Governance** — enable the tasks you want (content freshness, SEO, broken links, etc.).
- **Schedule** — Tasks run on a schedule (e.g. daily). Check Action Scheduler in wp-admin for pending actions.

---

## Webhooks aren't firing

- **Gateway URL and API Token** — Must be configured. Webhooks are sent to the gateway.
- **Webhook events** — Enable the events you want in **WP Pinch → Webhooks** (post_status_change, new_comment, etc.).
- **Outbound requests** — Your host must allow wp_remote_post. Some managed hosts restrict this.
