# Frequently Asked Questions

## Does this require OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is recommended for the full experience (webhooks, chat, governance delivery), but the Abilities API and MCP server work with any MCP-compatible client. WP Pinch is the lobster; OpenClaw is the ocean. You can technically have a lobster without an ocean, but it's way less impressive.

---

## What WordPress version is required?

6.9 or later. That's when WordPress grew its Abilities API claws.

---

## Does this work with WooCommerce?

Yes! WooCommerce order status changes trigger webhooks, and WP Pinch adds 10 WooCommerce-specific abilities covering products, orders, customers, coupons, inventory, and revenue summaries. Your AI agent can check inventory faster than a lobster can snap a rubber band.

---

## Can I add custom abilities?

Absolutely. Use the `wp_pinch_abilities` filter:

```php
add_filter( 'wp_pinch_abilities', function ( array $abilities ): array {
    $abilities['my_custom_ability'] = array(
        'label'       => 'My Custom Ability',
        'description' => 'Does something custom.',
        'callback'    => 'my_custom_ability_callback',
        'category'    => 'custom',
        'capability'  => 'manage_options',
    );
    return $abilities;
} );
```

If you can dream it, you can register it.

## Is it production-ready?

WP Pinch passes PHPCS (WordPress-Extra + Security), PHPStan Level 6, and 160+ PHPUnit tests. Every ability has security guards, every input is sanitized, every output is escaped. It's as battle-tested as a lobster that survived the tank at Red Lobster.

---

## Is the API token stored securely?

It's stored in the WordPress options table with `show_in_rest => false`. For production hardening, we recommend using environment variables or a secrets manager. The token never appears in REST API responses and is never exposed to non-admin users. It's masked on the settings page.

---

## Can visitors chat without being logged in?

Yes, via Public Chat Mode. Enable the `public_chat` feature flag in **WP Pinch > Features**, then toggle the **Public Mode** setting on individual Pinch Chat blocks. Public chat uses a separate endpoint with its own rate limiting and session isolation. Each anonymous visitor gets a unique session key.

---

## What is Molt and how do I enable it?

Molt repackages a single post into multiple formats: social (Twitter, LinkedIn), email snippet, FAQ block, thread, summary, meta description, pull quote, key takeaways, and CTA variants. Use `/molt 123` in chat or the `wp-pinch/molt` ability. Molt is behind the `molt` feature flag — enable it in **WP Pinch > Features** to unlock.

---

## Can different pages have different AI agents?

Yes. Each Pinch Chat block has an **Agent ID** setting in the editor sidebar. Set it to override the global default agent for that specific block. You can have a sales assistant on your pricing page and a support agent on your docs page.

---

## I get 404 errors for admin.js and admin.css

You're running from source without built assets. Run `npm install && npm run build` in the plugin directory. The `build/` folder is generated by the build step and is not committed to the repo. If you installed via a release zip, the build is pre-included -- report it as a bug.

---

## Why lobster puns?

Because the alternative was crab puns, and that felt a little... sideways. Plus, OpenClaw. Claw. Lobster. Pinch. It was destiny.
